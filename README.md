# Transcribot

Written In: Ruby

This code sets up a Discord bot that listens for a !listen command. When the command is executed, the bot joins the voice channel the user is in, starts listening for audio input, and sends the audio data to Google Cloud Speech for transcription. The resulting text transcription is saved to a file called transcription.txt.

Note that in order to use this code, you will need to have a Google Cloud account and credentials set up. You will also need to install the google-cloud-speech and discordrb gems.
